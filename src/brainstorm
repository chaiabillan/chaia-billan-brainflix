App.js
- navbar 
- <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />

Pages: 
- Home (from the demo example, their first 3 pages are all combined here)
    - Navbar 
    - VideoPlayer
    - VideoPlayerDetails
    - VideoPlayerComments
    - VideoNext
    - VideoNavItem
- Video Upload 
    - Navbar


Using API to get data 
- url/comments
    - contains info for the navbaritem (breif overview of videodata)
    - use this for VideoNavItem (which VideoNext will then compile)
- url/comments/:id
    - contains detailed info for a specified video
    - use this info in the VideoDetails component 
- url/comments/:id/comments
    - contains the comments from said video
    - use this info for the comment section 





















so in order to make a separate "page" for each video
    - this would mean that each video has a separate path 
    - i think this path should depend on the video ID

    need to have a video page that takes in all of the components that the home page is taking in right now. 

    and so that means that the home page is just video[0]


Video Details Page
    - uses the same Page Component as Home Page
    - although, they have two separate Routes
        - 1. Home
        - 2. A selected video 
    - the route definiton for 2 could be the ID?

    For the Home Page, the video that should be displayed is the first video within the array of videos.
    For the Video Details Page, the video that should be displayed is the selected video within the array of videos.
